# Summary of Project:
This project simulates the Powerball Lottery game, based on the prize chart (as seen above). The user is prompted to select how many 
Powerball tickets they wish to purchase and the program calculates the cost and potential change made to the customer, the program then simulates the random distribution of lotto numbers. Once the user has purchased the Powerball ticket(s), it will begin the simulation of picking 5 random white balls and one powerball, and references the users' ticket(s) to notify them if they have won a prize, and total their net winnings (or losses).

The program also can query an API that will return the latest Official winning numbers and the date at which they were drawn.
For security, the API key used to call the API has been obscured. An API key can be generated by visiting <a href="collectapi.com">collectapi.com</a>
